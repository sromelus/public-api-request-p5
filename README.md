# Public API Requests

In this project, I used the fetch api the request 12 random employee profiles from the randomuser.com api.
When the response from the initial fetch request comes back, if it's OK. I use JavaScript and DOM manipulation to render
the employee data to the browser in card tile format.

Each employee card has a click event which opens up a modal that displays more info about that specific employee.

written language: javascript

* I am planning on adding search functionality, a way to toggle back and forth between employees when modal is activate, better error handling features.
